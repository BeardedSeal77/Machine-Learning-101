    "# SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "powerful collection of supervised learning algorithms for classification, regression and outlier detection tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "excels at finding the best separation line, called a hyperplane\n",
    "\n",
    "well-suited for complex classification problems, especially when dealing with smaller datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strengths \n",
    "\n",
    "• Effective for Complex Data: SVMs can handle high-dimensional data and perform well on complex classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Good Generalizability: By maximizing the margin, SVMs tend to perform well on unseen data, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "• Computational Cost: Training SVMs can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Tuning Parameters: SVMs involve parameters that need to be tuned for optimal performance, which can require some experimentation."
