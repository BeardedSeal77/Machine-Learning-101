    "Clustering in machine learning is the process of organizing unlabeled data points into suitably similar groups, called clusters. These groups are formed based on similarities between the data points. It's like sorting a pile of socks by color - the algorithm finds socks that are similar (same color) and puts them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Unsupervised learning: Unlike classification where data points have predefined labels, clustering deals with unlabeled data. The algorithm figures out the similarities on its own.\n",
    "-   Similarity measure: A distance metric is used to determine how similar data points are. Common examples include Euclidean distance for continuous data and Hamming distance for categorical data.\n",
    "-   Applications: Clustering has a wide range of applications like customer segmentation in marketing, image compression, and anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering groups similar data points together, enabling  the discovery or identification of hidden patterns or relationships within the data.\n",

    "-   Clustering is a form of machine learning where groups, clusters, or classes, are not known ahead of time so groupings are created by looking at similar and shared characteristics among the things being grouped. (homogeneous groups)\n",
    "-   Given a set of potential class members, the task of clustering is to establish the existence of two or more classes or clusters in the members.\n",
    "-   These clusters are often determined through trial and error by grouping things together by looking for similar features, analyzing the results to see how good they are, and repeating this learning process until the groups are deemed acceptable.\n",
    "-   Clustering is an example of unsupervised learning because classes are unknown at the start."

    "\n",
    "-   Classification: This is a supervised learning technique. It involves using labeled data, where each data point has a predefined class label. The machine learning algorithm learns from this labeled data to classify new, unlabeled data points. For instance, an algorithm can be trained on emails labeled as \"spam\" or \"not spam\" to classify new incoming emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Clustering: This is an unsupervised learning technique. Unlike classification, clustering deals with unlabeled data. The algorithm identifies similarities between data points and groups them accordingly. These groups, called clusters, are formed based on the inherent patterns or characteristics within the data itself. For example, a clustering algorithm can group customers based on their purchase history, revealing shopping habits or demographics.\n",

    "-   Define the number of clusters (k): This is a crucial parameter, and choosing the right k can significantly impact the results. There are techniques to help you decide on the optimal k, but it often involves some experimentation.\n",
    "-   Initialize centroids: These are the initial representatives for each cluster, typically chosen randomly from the data points. You can think of them as the \"centers of gravity\" for each cluster.\n",
