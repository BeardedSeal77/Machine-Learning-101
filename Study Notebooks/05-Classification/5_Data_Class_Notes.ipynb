    "Classification problem in machine learning are problems where one wants to predict\n",
    "a category or class for new data points. Classification makes use of labelled training data,\n",
    "where each data point is assigned pre-defined categories. Classification algorithms attempt to\n",
    "determine a decision boundary between the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision boundary is like a dividing line (in lower dimensions) or a separating surface (in\n",
    "higher dimensions). It's what the algorithm learns to distinguish between different categories.\n",
    "Imagine you have data points representing red and green marbles, as shown above. The\n",
    "decision boundary is the line the algorithm draws to separate the red marbles from the green\n",
    "ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In summary:\n",
    "• Classification is a form of machine learning where two or more\n",
    "distinct groups, categories, or classes, of things are known ahead of time (pre-defined) and used to group additional things.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The features of members of each class are analyzed or learned, and then generalized to build an understanding of what it means to be a member of each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The generalizations are then compared with potential new member and used to “classify” each into the best fitting category. The result is a classification of each of the new members into one of the pre-defined categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Classification is an example of supervised learning because the categories or classes are known ahead of time\n",
